Init:
	- Signup and create user account
	- Edit profile page
	- Profile is viewable by other users
	- Delete self

Pages to build:
	- Login
	- Signup
	- Profile

Two-Roles:
	- 'user' and 'admin'
	- First created account is automatically 'admin'
	- Admin can view all users, give/take admin to other users, delete user



More to come as I figure this out.
